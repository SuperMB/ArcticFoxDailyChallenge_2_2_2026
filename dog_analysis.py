### The focus of this challenge is creating categories, pivoting, and getting counts for category matches

## We will count the number of Dalmations in the dataset from ages 4 to 7! How cute!


# Load the dog_speeds.csv

# Create labels / ranges to split the dogs into age categories
# Note, we primarily want to know the dogs aged 4 to 7

# Pivot the table to see the count of each breed for each age range

# Get the number of Dalmations aged 4 to 7 and submit the count!
